# CSS Only Fixed Table Headers

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tjvantoll/pen/JEKIu](https://codepen.io/tjvantoll/pen/JEKIu).

A quick example showing how fixed table headers can be created with a single semantic table and no JavaScript.

Supports IE10 and up.  Degrades nicely to IE < 10 though, the table simply isn't scrollable anymore.
